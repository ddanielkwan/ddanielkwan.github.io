## About Myself
I am an aspiring data scientist, currently enrolled at Wilfrid Laurier University for Bachelor of Science majoring in Data Science. I am in my 3rd year of study and had the oppurtunity to not only learn in a classroom environment, but also work in a dynamic environment in my co op at Sun Life as a Cloud Technology Analyst.

I have a strong passion for learning new things and I have worked on a few projects regarding data science such as machine learning and data visualization. I am a fast learner that is only getting better over time.
